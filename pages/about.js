          The Pokémon franchise revolves around 905 fictional species of
          collectible monsters, each having unique designs, skills, and powers.
          Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that
          inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The designs for the multitude of
          species can draw inspiration from anything such as animals, plants,
          mythological creatures and inanimate objects. Many Pokémon are capable
          of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form
          changes and achieve similar results. There are also some of them that
          cannot evolve. Originally, only a handful of artists led by Ken
          Sugimori designed Pokémon. However, by 2013 a team of 20 artists
          worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu
          Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Each iteration
          of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous
          creatures. The vast array of creatures is commonly divided into
          Generations, with each division primarily encompassing new titles in
          the main video game series and often a change of handheld platform.
          Generation I refers to Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow; Generation II
          refers to Gold, Silver, and Crystal; Generation III refers to Ruby,
          Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald; Generation IV refers to
          Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver; Generation V
          refers to Black, White, Black 2, and White 2; Generation VI refers to
          X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire; Generation VII refers to Sun,
          Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon, Lets Go, Pikachu!, and Lets Go, Eevee!;
          and Generation VIII refers to Sword, Shield, Brilliant Diamond,
          Shining Pearl, and Legends: Arceus. Each Generation is also marked by
          the addition of new Pokémon: 151 in Generation I in the Kanto region,
          100 in Generation II in the Johto region, 135 in Generation III in the
          Hoenn region, 107 in Generation IV in the Sinnoh region, 156 in
          Generation V in the Unova region, 72 in Generation VI in the Kalos
          region, 88 in Generation VII in the Alola and Kanto regions, and 96 in
          Generation VIII in the Galar and Hisui regions. Due to the large
          number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into articles by
          generation. The 905 Pokémon are organized by their number in the
          National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides
          various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided
          into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced
          at the time of their respective generations along with older
          generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the
          100 species introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original
          151 species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter
          Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the
          respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical
          Pokémon. Generation V is a notable exception, as Victini is the first
          Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex and is also uniquely numbered as number
          000.
